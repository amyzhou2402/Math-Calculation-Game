# Math-Calculation-Game

Basic arithmetic game app. The app chooses two random
numbers between 0 and 100, and one random arithmetic operation (i.e., addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division). 

The user needs to type in the result of the operation as quickly as
possible. The app will respond with a message that displays whether the userâ€™s calculation
was right or wrong. A second activity displaying the message is desirable.
